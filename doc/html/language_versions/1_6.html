          Upgrading a document from an earlier version of quickbook shouldn't be
          too hard. The first thing to do is update the version in the docinfo block.
          For example, if you were updating the Xpressive documentation, the existing
          docinfo block looks like:
        </p>
<pre class="programlisting">[library Boost.Xpressive
    [quickbook 1.3]
    ...
]
</pre>
<p>
          Change this to:
        </p>
<pre class="programlisting">[library Boost.Xpressive
    [quickbook 1.6]
    [compatibility-mode 1.3]
    ...
]
</pre>
<p>
          The <code class="literal">compatibility-mode</code> tag ensures that automatically
          generated links won't change. It might turn out that it isn't required,
          but in Xpressive's case if it isn't included it will break a lot of links.
        </p>
<p>
          Then try building it. You might need to fix some stray square brackets.
          The new version has a stricter parser which will have an error for brackets
          which don't pair up. They might be there by mistake, in which case they
          should probably be deleted, or if they're intentional escaped. For example,
          to write out the half-open range [a,b), use: <code class="computeroutput">\[a,b)</code>.
        </p>
<p>
          Next, you might need to reconsider how templates and macros are defined.
          If you <code class="computeroutput">include</code> a file to use its templates, you'll now need
          to <code class="computeroutput">import</code> it instead as templates are now scoped by included
          files. Also, if you define templates and macros in your main quickbook
          file, you might want to put them into a separate file and <code class="computeroutput">import</code>
          that, which allows the main documentation files to concentrate on the structure
          and contents of the document, making them easier to read.
        </p>
<p>
          Now that headings can have ids, it can be a good idea to add ids to existing
          headings. This means that the headings will have more predictable ids which
          don't change when the text of the heading changes. In order to preserve
          links you can use the existing generated id as the heading.
        </p>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="language_versions.1_6.docinfo"></a><a class="link" href="1_6.html#language_versions.1_6.docinfo" title="Includes with docinfo">Includes with docinfo</a>
</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
            In quickbook 1.5 if you include a file which starts with a docinfo block,
            it's ignored and the file is expanded in place. In quickbook 1.6 it's
            treated as a document nested in the current position. So if it has an
            'article' docinfo block, boostbook 'article' tags are used.
          </p>
<p>
            It also mostly generates the same markup as if the file was converted
            separately - so for example, the same ids are generated, the document
            is processed using the language version specified in the docinfo block.
            If no language is specified it uses the default (1.1) not the version
            of the document that included it. This might seem surprising, but is
            requried so that quickbook will convert it the same way as if it was
            converted separately.
          </p>
<p>
            So for the most part, includes with a docinfo are like an <code class="computeroutput">xinclude</code>,
            apart from a couple of differences. Templates and macros defined in the
            parent document are used in the included document, and the id generator
            rewrites ids that clash between multiple documents.
          </p>
<p>
            If an included document doesn't have a docinfo block, it's just included
            as before.
          </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">

          docinfo block</a>
</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
            You can now expand macros in text fields in the docinfo block. In the
            top docinfo block only the predefined macros are available, but in nested
            documents macros defined in the parent document are also available.
          </p>
<p>
            There's a small bug here - this leaks into older versions for the <code class="computeroutput">license</code>
            and <code class="computeroutput">purpose</code> fields, but since only the predefined macros
            are available, it's unlikely to break any existing documents. So I'd
            rather not complicate the code further by fixing that.
          </p>
</div>
<div class="section">

          macros</a>
</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
            A long standing quickbook bug is that macros are scoped by file, but
            templates aren't. So you can define templates in a separate file and
            include them, but not macros. This has been fixed so that templates defined
            in one file won't 'leak' into another.
          </p>
<p>
            But this means there's no way to define templates in a separate file
            - a useful feature. To do this the <code class="computeroutput">import</code> element has been
            adapted to also support quickbook files. If a quickbook file is imported,
            the templates and macros defined in it are added to the current scope,
            but nothing else contained in that file is used. This could be used to
            create template and macro library files. This matches the existing semantics
            of importing code snippets.
          </p>
<p>
            When importing templates, they're bound to the language version of the
            file they were defined in. This means that if you import them into a
            file with a different version it won't change the way they're interpreted.
            Although, as we'll see <a class="link" href="1_6.html#compatibility">later</a>, the
            generated boostbook is slightly different.

<p>
            As <code class="computeroutput">import</code> now supports quickbook files, <code class="computeroutput">include</code>
            also supports source files. It includes any quickbook contained in comments
            outside of code snippets. Code snippets in the file are available to
            be expanded within the file but are scoped to the file. In exactly the
            same manner as when templates and macros are scoped in an included quickbook
            file.

</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
            Id generation in quickbook 1.5 is a bit buggy, but that can't be fixed
            without a version switch as it will break existing documents. For example
            in quickbook 1.5 when you include a quickbook file, it stops using the
            explicit id from the documentation info and generates a new id from the
            document title to use instead.
          </p>
<p>
            The id generator in quickbook 1.6 has been improved in some other ways
            to. When generating ids from section titles, table titles etc. it always
            uses the quickbook source rather than the generated boostbook to generate
            the id. It then cleans up the id slightly, trimming leading and trailing
            underscores and replacing multiple underscores with a single underscore.
            Then if the newly generated part of the id is longer than 32 characters
            it truncates it.
          </p>
<p>
            While the new id generator generally creates better ids, it's more likely
            to generate duplicates so quickbook needs to handle duplicates better.
            When there are multiple identical ids, quickbook chooses one to use based
            on a priority list - anchors are preferred, then explicit document and
            section ids, then other explicit ids, followed by the generated ids.
            Then any other explicit ids in the document have numbers added to avoid
            duplicates - first the explicit ids in the order they appear and then
            the generated ids. A generated id which accidentally clashes with an
            explicit id should never change the explicit id.
          </p>
<p>
            Older language versions still generate the same ids they always have,
            with the exception of duplicate ids which are handled using the new mechanism
            - this is not a breaking change since duplicate ids can't be linked to.
          </p>

<a name="language_versions.1_6.compatibility"></a><a name="compatibility"></a><a class="link" href="1_6.html#language_versions.1_6.compatibility" title="Compatibility Mode">Compatibility
          Mode</a>
</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
            As mentioned before, changing the id generator will break links in documents
            written using an old language version. So to ease the transition a 'compatibility
            mode' is used, this just requires an extra attribute in the docinfo,
            for example if you're converting a 1.5 document to 1.6:
          </p>
<pre class="programlisting">[article Document
[quickbook 1.6]
[compatibility-mode 1.5]
]
</pre>
<p>
            This means the document will be parsed as 1.6, using all the new features,
            but ids (and possibly other markup) will generated as they were for a
            1.5 document.
          </p>
<p>
            Compatibility mode is also implicitly used when generating templates
            written in a different language version to the current document. So the
            template is parsed in the version it was written for, but generates boostbook
            that's compatible with the current document.
          </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="language_versions.1_6.version"></a><a class="link" href="1_6.html#language_versions.1_6.version" title="Version info outside of document info block">Version info outside
          of document info block</a>
</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
            Can now use <code class="computeroutput">quickbook</code> and <code class="computeroutput">compatibility-mode</code>
            tags at the beginning of the file. Either before or without a document
            info block. This is useful for files just containing templates, which
            don't really need a document info block.
          </p>
<p>
            If you don't specify <code class="computeroutput">compatibility-mode</code>, the behaviour depends
            on whether or not you have a docinfo block. If you do it uses the file's
            quickbook version, if you don't it inherits the parent's compatibility
            mode even if you specify a quickbook version. This is the right thing
            to do - mixing compatibility modes within documents is problematic. It
            might actually be a mistake to allow them to specified outside docinfo
            blocks.
          </p>
<p>
            This change is also backdated to older versions. So when including from
            an older version, the included file's version can be set (older versions
            ignore document info in included files).

<p>

</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
            In 1.6, quickbook is more consistent about how it parses punctuation.
            Escapes are now supported in links, anchors, table titles, image attributes
            etc. The flip side of this is that quickbook is now stricter about unescaped
            brackets. They can still be used, but need to match up, otherwise there's
            an error.
          </p>
<p>
            Since quickbook now matches up square brackets it will fix some mis-parses.
            For example <code class="computeroutput">[*[bold]]</code> used to parse as <span class="bold"><strong>[bold</strong></span>]
            - note that the closing square bracket isn't bold, now it parses as
            <span class="bold"><strong>[bold]</strong></span>. In this case it's just a subtle
            visual difference, but it could cause odd problems, for example when
            nested in a table cell.

<p>
            Table titles are now parsed as phrases, so some markup is allowd:
          </p>
<pre class="programlisting">[table [*bold title]]
</pre>
<p>
            Which is an empty table with a bold title. The title is no longer ended
            by a newline, but by either a closing square bracket, or two opening
            square brackets - which you get at the start of the table cells, so this
            now works:
          </p>

<p>
            A problem when using <code class="computeroutput">xi:include</code> tags in escaped boostbook
            is that you typically don't know which directory the boostbook file will
            be in, so it's impossible to use relative links. This can be fixed by
            adding an <code class="computeroutput">xml:base</code> attribute to the document tag. To do
            this use the new <code class="computeroutput">xmlbase</code> attribute in your document's docinfo
            block. For example to make escaped <code class="computeroutput">xi:include</code>s be relative
            to the directory of the file:
          </p>
<pre class="programlisting">[library Library documentation
[quickbook 1.6]
[xmlbase .]
]
</pre>
<p>
            Any paths in <code class="computeroutput">xinclude</code> elements will be rewritten accordingly.
            Note that most documents won't need this, and probably shouldn't use
            it. Only use it if you're totally sure that you will need it.

            There's a new parser for template declarations and parameters which does
